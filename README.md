RStudio Cloud for Education
===========================

This is the source of the slides for my talk, *RStudio Cloud for Education*, given at `rstudio::conf 2019`. These slides were created using the awesome [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package.

A good bit of my talk was a demo, so this is only part of it. I will update this README with a link to the recording once it is available. See also:
