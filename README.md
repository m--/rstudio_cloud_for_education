RStudio Cloud for Education
===========================

This is the source of my slides for the *RStudio Cloud for Education* talk given at `rstudio::conf 2019`. These slides were created using the awesome [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package.

A good bit of this talk was a demo, and you can watch the whole thing [here](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/rstudio-cloud-for-education).
